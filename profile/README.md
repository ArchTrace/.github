# 🎯 ArchTrace
> Understand a codebase in minutes, not days.

ArchTrace is an architecture visualization tool that transforms complex codebases into clear, interactive graphs. Using static analysis, we map control flow, execution paths, and dependencies—making even the most tangled legacy code navigable.

## Why ArchTrace?
- **Onboard faster:** New team members understand the architecture in hours, not weeks
- **Navigate confidently:** Visual maps replace endless grep searches
- **Spot complexity:** Identify hotspots and refactoring opportunities at a glance
- **Document automatically:** Your code's architecture, always up-to-date

## Perfect for
- 🚀 Joining a new development team
- 🏗️ Working with large or legacy codebases
- 📚 Understanding poorly documented systems
- 🔍 Code reviews and architectural decisions
